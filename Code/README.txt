README of Delaunay Triangulation

Generate random points or worst case with 
generatePointLimite.m
generatePointRandom.m

Compile the file with the Makefile (adapted to your computer)

Execute the file ./myDelaunay a b c d
a is if you want  limit (1) or random (0) points 
b is if you want less (0) or more (1) robust
c is if you want the evolution (1) just the final graph (2) or no graph at all (0)
d is if you want to randomly permute the points recieved in the file (1) or not (0)
	(d can generate some errors but will compile)
	
	
To reproduce the graph in the report, launch 
time.m
